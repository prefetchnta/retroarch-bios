That's my story,|just the way I lived it.

It's impossible|for me to calculate|my return|trajectory.
I'll probably drift|in space for a very|long time...

Hi Conrad. You must be|wondering how you recorded|this message without|remembering it.
Good question, but it would|take too long to explain|and time is short, and if|you want to save your hide...
 You must contact your old| friend Ian in New| Washington.
He'll explain it all there.|Good luck and watch your|back,because it's my life|you're playing with.
Slowly, the rays from the|regenerator re-implant the|memories in Conrad's brain.
