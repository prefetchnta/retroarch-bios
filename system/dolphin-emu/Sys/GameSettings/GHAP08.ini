# GHAP08 - Resident Evil 2

[OnFrame]
# Work around a game bug that causes background sounds to be zeroed during load.
# The bug was masked on real hardware by dcache. This patch fully fixes the bug
# and should also work on real hardware. Dolphin doesn't emulate dcache because
# the performance hit would be huge.
