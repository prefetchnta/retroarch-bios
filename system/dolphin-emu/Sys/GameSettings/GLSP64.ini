# GLSP64 - Gladius

[OnFrame]
# This game can deadlock the CPU and GPU by setting FIFO breakpoints too
# infrequently, provided the CPU gets too far ahead, as can happen under Dolphin
# due to timing inaccuracies. The game never clears breakpoints, and it will
# skip setting them if the previous one has not been hit by the GPU. If the CPU
# gets far enough ahead it will reach the FIFO high water mark and trigger an
# overflow interrupt, causing the render thread to be suspended. The GPU will
# make forward progress until it hits the last set breakpoint. However, if the
# distance between that breakpoint and the FIFO write pointer is greater than
# the low water mark, then the GPU will never generate an underflow interrupt
# and the render thread will never be resumed. This patch forces the game to
# update the breakpoint unconditionally and has been tested on real hardware
# with no apparent ill effect.
